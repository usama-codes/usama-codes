## Projects

### 1. 🎾 University Sports and Societal Activities App
- **What It Does:** Helps students reserve sports grounds, implement a waiting system, and stay updated on society events.
- **Tech Used:** Java, Android
- **Fun Fact:** Built during my second semester – the perfect balance of productivity and procrastination!

### 2. 🖥️ Jarvis: My Personal Assistant
- **What It Does:** A voice-activated assistant for managing tasks like shutting down the computer, controlling applications, sending messages, weather forecasts, and playing music.
- **Tech Used:** Python, Speech Recognition, Flask
- **Fun Fact:** It’s still a work in progress, but it’s already handling basic commands like a pro!

### 3. 🕵️‍♂️ Cancer Detection System
- **What It Does:** Detects cancerous tumors (benign vs. malignant) in full-body images using CNNs, developed during my internship at Murabbi.
- **Tech Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Fun Fact:** I managed the entire ML pipeline – from data preprocessing and augmentation to model training and evaluation.

### 4. 🌍 Search Engine (Project in Progress)
- **What It Does:** A search engine designed to handle large-scale queries using inverted indexing and efficient ranking algorithms, focusing on performance and speed.
- **Tech Used:** C++, Python, Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Fun Fact:** It’s optimized for querying through barrels and the use of hash functions for document ranking.
